Here is the description to run the code files and to have the portal access.

Download and Install any local web server such as XAMPP.

Download the code zip folder / normal folder

Open your XAMPP Control Panel and start the "Apache" and "MySQL".

Extract the downloaded code file.

If the user have XAMPP, copy the extracted code folder / normal folder and paste it into the XAMPP's "htdocs" folder.
