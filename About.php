          <p>An EHR (Electronic Health Record) system can be considered as a one-stop solution for connecting patients, hospitals and doctors by providing a centralized and secure platform for storing, sharing and managing patient health information. This allows for better communication, coordination and continuity of care among healthcare providers, leading to improved patient outcomes. The key features of EHR system is the ability to easily share patient information between healthcare providers, regardless of location. This eliminates the need for patients to carry paper records or repeat their medical history to different providers.
